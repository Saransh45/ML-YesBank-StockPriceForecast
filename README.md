# ML-YesBank-StockPriceForecast
This project demonstrates a machine learning solution for predicting Yes Bank stock closing prices. It uses regression models like Random Forest and XGBoost on historical stock data to forecast future closing prices. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions.

#Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict Yes Bank’s stock closing prices. Using historical stock data, it applies regression models to forecast future prices. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

#Features

Historical stock data preprocessing

Feature engineering for time-series analysis

Regression model training (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and MSE

Visualization of predicted vs actual stock prices

#Dataset

The dataset contains historical daily stock prices of Yes Bank, including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.

#Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Matplotlib, Seaborn

#How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone <repo-url>


Install required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the prediction script:

python yesbank_stock_prediction.py

#Results

The model predicts closing prices with performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MSE, and visualizes the predicted vs actual closing prices for easy analysis.
